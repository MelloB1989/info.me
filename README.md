# Kartik Deshmukh - Introduction

Hello, I'm Kartik Deshmukh, also known as MelloB. As a passionate developer, my journey with technology began at the age of 12, and it has been an exhilarating exploration ever since. From Linux, IoT, and embedded systems to ethical hacking, web and app development, cloud computing, cryptocurrency, and AI, my curiosity drives me to delve into various tech fields continuously.

**The Essence of My Passion:**
Building is at the core of my existence. From a young age, I've been fascinated by how things work, often dismantling household electronics to satisfy my curiosity. This innate desire to understand and create has fueled my love for technology, empowering me to build solutions that can make a difference in society.

**Key Experiences That Shaped My Journey:**

1. **School Days:**
   - My school played a crucial role in my early explorations with hardware. Tinkering with Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, and RC models, I began my journey into the world of technology, laying the foundation for my future endeavors.

2. **COVID-19 Lockdown:**
   - The lockdown period was a transformative time for me. While others faced challenges, I immersed myself in learning various software technologies. From ethical hacking and cloud computing to web development and cryptocurrency, I dedicated 9-10 hours daily to coding, significantly advancing my skills.

3. **Crypto Mining Automation:**
   - One of my most significant projects was automating crypto mining for a client with 150-200 servers worldwide. Despite being a beginner, I engineered a robust system for automated installation, health checks, and analytics, which boosted my confidence immensely.

4. **Entrepreneurship in College:**
   - My entrepreneurial spirit flourished in college with the creation of AUSpot, a social media platform for our college. Despite initial success, challenges with server costs and lack of support from the college management taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and resilience.

5. **Founding Noobs Learning:**
   - Witnessing the confusion among students about learning coding, I founded Noobs Learning, a developer community providing resources and video courses. Our community grew rapidly, conducting free workshops and events, emphasizing the importance of accessible education.

6. **Birth of Avidia:**
   - Realizing the limitations of video courses, I brainstormed Avidia, a unique solution to help students learn coding effectively. With a foundation in clear Java basics, I believed in the power of documentation over tutorials, leading to the conceptualization of Avidia over six months of dedicated brainstorming.

These experiences have profoundly shaped my journey, driving my continuous quest to build, innovate, and empower others through technology. I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities it holds.

## Raw:
I am preparing my self introduction, help me draft it.

I am Kartik Deshmukh aka MelloB. I am a keen developer with a great passion for technology. I have been coding since I was 12, I have explored various fields like Linux, IoT and embedded systems, Ethical Hacking, Web and app development, cloud computing, cryptocurrency, and AI, and still continuing to explore more and more.

I love to engineer and build, to build is my passion, that is the core reason I love technology as it empowers me to build things which make difference. Since childhood I've always dreamt to setup a company to help the society using tech. Before I started coding, I was completely into hardware, opening up every electronic device in my house to see how it works from the inside, and I think this is what makes me a true engineer. I was try to see things and wonder how they work and reverse engineer them, this has helped me a lot to engineer my own things over the time. There is nothing other than technology which drives me crazy.

I have been a very different kid since childhood, I have no interest in games, movies, hanging out, outdoor games, singing, dancing, the only thing I have ever loved to do the most is to build, build and build. There are a couple of experiences which have shaped me over the past few years:  Experience 1: My school My school has been an essential part of my learnings, I was exploring a lot of hardware during my school, playing around with Arduino’s, Raspberry pi’s, breadboards, jumper wires, I loved RC and to build RC. My school also made me explore my fullest in hardware and start my journey in software.

Experience 2: Lockdown during COVID
While covid was a hard time to go through, it did turn out the best time for me to explore software, in just span of 1.5 years I got my hands dirty in ethical hacking, cloud, app development, web development, crypto trading and web3. I was a JEE aspirant but my hunger to explore technology and play with it everyday made me completely ignore my JEE preparation. I used to wake up at 9 and then code for 9-10 hours straight a day. I learnt php, bash, aws, azure, python flask, Django, Wordpress, reacts, expresses, basic android app dev, hosting of static websites, cloud flare, and many more things.
This did result in me getting 19.05% in JEE, but I don’t care about it because when I entered college I found myself 3-4 years ahead of all of the students.

Experience 3: Crypto mining
This was when I made my first biggest pay check, I got a client from Africa who wanted me to automate crypto mining for him across 150-200 servers of his across the globe. I was a beginner, I never say no to things, within just 3 months I built a robust system which could automate the installation script of mining software on each worker node, do health checks, give analytics and more. I did complete system design, bash automation, deployment on AWS EC2, all from scratch. This is where I could really say I “engineered” it. This gave me immense confidence of my capabilities.

Experience 4: Start of entrepreneurship in college
Even though I had the spirit of entrepreneurship since childhood, things really took off once I joined college, I had a social media like platform which I had modified from an open source project in lockdown. One day, when I was in lab with my friends, I installed the website on a machine in the lab and hosted the site, after which I gave it’s access to all my friends to show them the site. Me and my friend realised this could take off if we implement it well, thus we started a dedicated social media website just for our college called AUSpot. it took off fast and we very early crossed 1k users, but I could not bear the costs of the AWS servers for which we went to our college management for help, the management did agree to support us but they just ghosted us eventually, this is when I realised college won’t support us at any cost.

Experience 5: Start of Noobs Learning
Since I had entered college I saw almost every student confused and puzzled, legit everyone would ask me the same question, who did I start coding, how did I learn it, what are the resources
. This is the reason I thought of starting a developer community for students to provide all resources and have video courses on our community site. We also had competition from another community which was not providing much value to students, they were almost scamming students. This heated things up and our community grew manifold. From 100-300-600-2000 in just a month. We conducted many free workshops and events for these students to provide value and grow our community more and more.

Experience 6: Birth of Avidia
I very soon realised that video courses are not a right way to learn to code, given the fact that I myself have not seen any tutorial to learn any technology. This is because I knew java completely (was included in school syllabus) so my basics were clear, and to learn the tech I always preferred docs. This why I started brainstorming Avidia as a unique solution to solve this problem of students. I spent 6 months to brainstorm Avidia as a solution, I have a book just filled of my ideas during brain storm. Avidia is a product which I trust will help many students learn what they need!  These have been some of my most impacting ecperiences of my life till now.
